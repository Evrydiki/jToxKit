/***
  * The rationale behind this skill-set is that any data transformation that could be needed from the raw response 
  * to the data expected by the widgets should happen only once. If we have each widget directly being notified 
  * upon query's response, then each widget should transform the data by itself, which could potentially be
  * time consuming. 
  * With this skill-set encapsulation we provide the mechanism for widget(s) to listen to `data ready` notification. 
  * The actual data transformation, of course, is going to be done by another skill set, which will provide the only
  * expected method - `translateData`.
  *
  * Consumers are registered pretty much the same way each listener is.
  * There two methods that are expected to be present - `init` and `afterTranslation`.
  * The first one is optional and is invoked once, when the Consumption-enabled entity
  * is initialized itself.
  * The other method - `afterTranslation` is invoked on every successfull response.
